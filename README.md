# Blog Application
This entire Web Application Was Developed and implemented to fulfill my academic requirement 
in which I had to develop an application using MYSQL Database, And this is my Mini Project on DataBase Management System,
This has been developed using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,PHP,MYSQL,
To run this project PHP &  MYSQL need to be installed & the easiest way to run PHP files using Command Prompt is
Go to your Project Folder and type " PHP -S localhost:8000 ".
Thank You.
